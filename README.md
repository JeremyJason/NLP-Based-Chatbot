Project Title: Industrial Safety Chatbot: Analyzing Incident Descriptions to Highlight Safety Risks

Project Description:

The objective of this project is to design a machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based chatbot utility that assists professionals in identifying safety risks based on incident descriptions. The project focuses on analyzing a database comprising accident records from 12 different plants in three countries, representing one of the largest industries in Brazil and globally. The aim is to gain insights into why employees continue to experience injuries and accidents in industrial plants, some of which result in fatalities.

The provided dataset contains various columns, including the accident occurrence timestamp, anonymized country and city information, industry sector, accident severity level (ranging from I to VI), potential accident severity level, gender of the person involved, whether they are an employee or a third party, critical risk description, and a detailed account of how the accident transpired.

The project is divided into three milestones. In Milestone 1, the focus is on data preprocessing and ML classification. The dataset is imported and subjected to data cleansing and NLP preprocessing techniques. The cleaned data is then prepared in a suitable format, such as .xlsx or .csv, for further analysis. Basic ML classifiers are designed, trained, and tested using the prepared data to classify incidents based on their safety risk levels.

Milestone 2 involves the application of more advanced techniques, including the design, training, and testing of neural network and recurrent neural network (RNN) or long short-term memory (LSTM) classifiers. The best-performing classifier is selected and saved using pickle. Finally, a comprehensive final report is prepared, summarizing the entire project, including the methodology, results, and insights gained from the analysis.

Optionally, in Milestone 3(currently doing), a clickable user interface (UI) based chatbot is designed to provide a more user-friendly and interactive experience. The UI can be implemented using libraries such as Tkinter for desktop applications or Flask/Django for web-based services.

By leveraging ML and DL techniques, this project aims to enhance industrial safety by enabling professionals to better understand safety risks associated with specific incident descriptions. The developed chatbot utility can assist in identifying potential hazards, allowing industries and companies around the world to take proactive measures to prevent accidents, injuries, and fatalities in their manufacturing plants.
